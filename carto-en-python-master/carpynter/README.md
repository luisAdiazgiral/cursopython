# carpynter

This is a place-holder readme for a custom tool used by Eduardo Graells-Garrido (@carnby) and Diego Caro (@diegocaro) in their "Data Science Workshop" held at Universidad del Desarrollo.

carpynter is a visualization tool built on top of matplotlib, seaborn, geopandas, and smopy. Actually, we bundle smopy in the code. We will detail everything once the tool reaches a more mature status :)
